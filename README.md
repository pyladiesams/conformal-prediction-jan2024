### [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--WcrDRtrYk&t=1s) of the presentation: Leveraging conformal prediction for calibrated probabilistic time series forecasts - Inge van den Ende, PyData Eindhoven 2023

## Workshop description
During the workshop we will apply conformal prediction:
1. add a prediction interval to a point forecast 
2. calibrate a probabilistic forecast 

## Requirements
Python >= 3.10 and experience with making a regression forecast. In the workshop we take a LightGBM
model as an example to make a forecast, but this model is not explained in the workshop.


## Usage
* Clone the repository
* Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Start jupyter lab and navigate to the workshop folder
* Open the first workshop notebook
